planck06c	test_conv, 15cg, 45mg with 0.2 noise-scaling, sanity check on rusty. Using planck_pix.py
planck06d	same as planck06c but with the smica icov_pix
planck06e	same as planck06d but with the smica icov_pix weighted to take into account area difference near poles.
planck06f	same as planck06e but with the smica mask as well, also unsmoothed icov.
planck06g	same as planck06f but with no-round-icov
